# 033 Design Thinking Outputs

This section documents the outputs from the Design Thinking process, including the Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test stages. Note that visual elements (e.g., diagrams, boards, sketches) are placeholders for manual insertion.

## Stage 1: Empathize

This stage focused on understanding the stakeholders' thoughts and feedback through research and interviews.

### Interview with the Stakeholders
Interviews were conducted with Sir Jojo Castillo (ITRO Director), Sir Carl Bueno (Faculty Member), Ms. Jo Anne de la Cuesta (Academic Services Office), Mr. Kimberly Malate (Registrar’s Office), and Ms. Shandy Alingasa (Student).

### Actual Personas
Based on interviews:
*   Jojo Castillo (Information Technology Resource Office)
*   Carl Dominique Bueno (Faculty Member)
*   Jo Anne de la Cuesta (Academic Services Office)
*   Kimberly Malate (Registrar’s Office)
*   Shandy Alingasa (Student)

### Theoretical Personas
(Placeholder for Figure 6, 7, 8, 9)

### Empathy Map
Empathy maps were created for each stakeholder.
(Placeholder for Figure 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)

### Pain-Gain Analysis Summary
The analysis highlighted challenges such as limited IT resources, disruptions, privacy concerns, and the need for an affordable, user-friendly, and transparent system.

## Stage 2: Define

This stage involved framing the central problems based on gathered insights.

### Clustered Problems
Problems were categorized into Classroom/Teaching, Technical, and Administrative issues.
*   **Classroom/Teaching Problems**: Manual process, time-consuming attendance, students leaving early.
*   **Technical Problems**: Separate onsite/online attendance, lack of centralized data, camera limitations.
*   **Administrative Problems**: Difficulty consolidating data, manual encoding, delayed notifications for absences.

### How-Might-We Questions
Questions were developed to encourage creative, solution-oriented thinking:
1.  How might we ensure accurate and reliable records despite technical limitations?
2.  How might we improve the use of time for attendance?
3.  How might we capture student engagement (onsite/online)?
4.  How might we make the system simple and non-disruptive during lectures?
5.  How might we improve the centralization of attendance data?
6.  How might we streamline the attendance process?
7.  How might we use these data to improve student engagement?
8.  How might we allow students to check in quickly without delays?
9.  How might we notify offices (such as Academic Services) about consistent student absences?

## Stage 3: Ideate

This stage focused on generating a wide range of possible solutions through collaboration and brainstorming.

### Brainstorming Session
Ideas and suggestions were gathered using MS Teams calls and a FigJam board.

### Crazy 8’s
Individual sketches representing solutions were created using FigJam's Crazy 8's template.

### Post-It Voting
Promising ideas were selected and prioritized through a Post-It Voting session on FigJam.

### Desirable, Viable, Feasible
Selected ideas were evaluated based on desirability, viability, and feasibility.

## Stage 4: Prototype

This stage involved developing initial prototypes to explore practical implementation.

### Storyboards
Storyboards were created to visualize user interactions.
(Placeholder for Figure 1 Team Storyboard Discussion, Figure 2, 3, 4, 5 Storyboards)

### Mockups and Sketches
Low-fidelity wireframes were developed for Student, Professor, and IT Admin interfaces.
(Placeholder for Figure 26 Student Interface, Figure 27 Professor Interface)

### Prototype
Interactive prototypes were designed using Figma, including login screens, terms and conditions, face registration, class schedules, and real-time attendance monitoring.
(Placeholder for Figure 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 Prototype Figures)

## Stage 5: Test

The prototype was presented to stakeholders for feedback.

### Feedback Interview with Ms. Shandy Alingasa
Initial feedback was gathered from Ms. Shandy Alingasa, who found the prototype user-friendly but noted that some features were more professor-centric.
