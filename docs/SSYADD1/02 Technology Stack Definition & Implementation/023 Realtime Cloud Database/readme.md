# 023 Realtime Cloud Database

## PostgreSQL

We have not decided on a specific Cloud provider for the Database, but we would like to use PostgreSQL in our case. PostgreSQL is used as the relational database for persistent data storage. It is known for its strong reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types and optimization features, making it suitable for complex data management and transactional workloads.
