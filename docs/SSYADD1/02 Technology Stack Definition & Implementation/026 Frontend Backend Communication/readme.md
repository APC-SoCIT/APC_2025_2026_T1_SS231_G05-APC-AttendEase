# 026 Frontend Backend Communication

## REST + WebSockets

Communication between the frontend and backend is established using a hybrid approach:

*   **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: Used for standard data operations, such as fetching and submitting data, ensuring stateless and cacheable interactions.
*   **WebSockets**: Employed for real-time, bidirectional communication, critical for features requiring instant updates and persistent connections between the client and server.
